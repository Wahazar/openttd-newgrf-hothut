HotHut - house replacement for tropical climate

Default houses have changed properties (mostly spawn later).
Additional custom early houses suitable for tropical climate, especially for Africa-themed scenarios. 
House apperance depend on sub-biome: middle-east style for desert, 
african clay or wattle huts for normal or rain forest terrain,
also some slope-dependend and water dependend stilt houses.
Improved house spawn switches.
Some houses belong to special groups (residental, slums) and are expected to be generated in separate clusters
rather than intermixed.
Slums houses yield small population and usually doesn't accept/produce mail, but many of them accept some water,
thus they can be used for water delivery in absence of water tower industry.

ToDo: construction stages, more modern houses.
